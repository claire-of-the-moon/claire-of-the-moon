            In the theory of programming and programming languages, I've always found the concept of &lsquo;composition&rsquo; to be very powerful. I think with software synths, we lean on that concept too. Composition takes several forms in synths: modulation, such as using an LFO to modulate filter frequency; summation, such as in a mixer; frequency modulation; there are probably other examples!
